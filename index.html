        <h1>Background</h1>

<p>The Ridgefield Board of Education is considering closing an elementary school due to a projected decline in K-5 enrollment below 2,000 students by 2014-2015.</p>

<p>The BOE claims this would save $950,000-$1M per year (approximately 1.2% of the $80M annual school operating budget.) However, many Ridgefield residents don't think they are considering all of the factors, and wonder if this action could cause more harm than good. </p>

<p>The purpose of this website is to consolidate information on the BOE's plans, academic studies of the effects of school closures, and names/contact details of the decision-makers involved. 
With this information, I hope the residents of Ridgefield will be better equipped to evaluate the BOE's plan and determine if it's in the community's best interest.</p>

</ol><h1>What's Wrong With Closing a School?</h1>

<h2>School Consolidation Does Not Save Money</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The decades following the 1960s saw an increase in the size of American schools and
classrooms. However, recent research indicates that <strong>large schools do not work for minority and low income students, tend to hurt attendance and student participation, and are not necessarily cost efficient</strong>. Irmsher (1997) summarizes the results of various studies that examined whether large schools have produced greater academic success at a lower cost; the ways in which small schools benefit students, parents, and teachers; and the need for establishing a collective school identity in conjunction with downsizing.</p></li>
<li><p>Reeves (2004) and Eyre &amp; Finn (2002) recount that between 1990 and 2000, total enrollment in West Virginia decreased 11%, 202 schools were closed, and education spending increased by 16%. <strong>Per pupil expenditures increased more in West
Virginia than in any other state, but student achievement remained stagnant during this period.
Transportation and administrative costs rose in spite of the declining numbers of students.</strong>. </p></li>
<li><p>Research by Cutshall (2003) reveals better outcomes for smaller schools or smaller learning communities within schools. <strong>Data from 489 schools indicate that smaller size can be cost effective</strong>. In light of these findings, some states are changing policies that favored consolidation and larger schools</p></li>
<li><p>A study by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association (2009) concludes <strong>there is no evidence that consolidation of schools will result in reduced expenses.</strong> The analysis of Woodland Hills merger shows cost increases. Analysis of potential merger/consolidation of York County school districts shows that substantial tax increases would be necessary. <strong>Mergers and consolidations that have occurred have not produced the promised savings. Rather, mergers have substantial front-end costs such as “leveling up.” There are also a number of items that provide additional frontend costs that individually may be considered small amounts but collectively can approach substantial sums in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>From Lytton (2011), "<strong>The financial costs of closing schools are often underestimated, starting with a miscalculation of one-time expenditures for moving students, staff and supplies...It is not unusual for such one-time expenses to exceed USD 1 million per school</strong>...Another potential financial cost is the loss of per-pupil funding if students opt out of public schools altogether. Eliminating neighbourhood schools and/or leasing shuttered schools to non-public agencies are actions that, if not well thought out, may encourage students to exit the public school system, only exacerbating the fiscal problems in struggling districts. In California for example, <strong>one school district predicted savings of $700,000 through consolidation, but ended up losing some $2.4 million in state funding as hundreds of students pulled out of the public system within months</strong>."</p></li>
</ul><h2>School Consolidation Can Harm Academic Achievement</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Findings from Skandera &amp; Sousa (2001): Arguments in favor of school consolidation often focus on increased efficiency and economies of scale. However, <strong>as school size increases, parental involvement decreases. Family effects account for 34-105 times as much variation in achievement as school inputs</strong>. Consolidation may or may not be economically viable, but <strong>distancing parents from schools may have a high cost</strong> to America's future--America's children</p></li>
<li><p>From Capps &amp; Maxwell (1999): The trend toward bigness and consolidation continues unabated, driven by political, economic, social, and demographic considerations, rather than extensive research attesting to small schools' educational benefits. <strong>School size significantly influences social interaction and degree of student alienation</strong>. We need to reclaim the small school's sense of community, caring, and meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>From Bard, Gardener &amp; Wieland (2006): Smaller districts have higher achievement, affective and social outcomes. <strong>Local school officials should be wary of merging several smaller elementary schools, at least if the goal is improved performance.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>In the same study by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association (2009) mentioned above: <strong>the evidence shows that consolidations have an adverse impact on academic achievement</strong>. The studies by a number of researchers around the nation have documented adverse impact on student performance. </p></li>
<li><p>From Viadero (2001): Studies conducted over the past 10 to 15 years suggest that <strong>in smaller schools, students come to class more often, drop out less, earn better grades, participate more often in extracurricular activities, feel safer, and show fewer behavior problems.</strong></p></li>
</ul><h2>School Consolidation Harms the Community</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>From Andrews (1974): Officials representing 60 school districts contributed information to this assessment of the experiences of school districts that have closed elementary schools in the past few years. <strong>Closure is a simple solution to the problem of excess space, but it is also a source of other problems, problems far more intricate and complex and much more difficult and costly to solve.</strong> Once an elementary school is closed, the environmental forces of out-migration, population decline, and neighborhood deterioration are set in motion.</p></li>
<li><p>A study by Lyson (2002) finds that schools serve as important markers of social and economic viability and vitality, and that the <strong>money that might be saved through school consolidation could be forfeited in lost taxes, declining property values, and lost business.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>A survey by Sell, Leistritz, &amp; Thompson (1996) was conducted in eight communities in North Dakota that had gone through school district consolidation and school closing during 1991-94. Over the next ten years, <strong>participation in community organizations increased in host (receiving) communities and declined in vacated (school-closing) communities</strong>, while retail trade and number of businesses declined in both types of communities. <strong>Quality of life scores did not differ by type of community before consolidation, declined in both types after consolidation, and were considerably lower in vacated communities</strong> than in host communities after consolidation.</p></li>
<li><p>From Lytton (2011): "Shuttering a school can therefore have widespread and lingering consequences for a neighbourhood, often falling disproportionately on poorer communities. <strong>Areas without good schools do not readily attract young families, and closing schools can decrease nearby property values</strong>. <strong>Communities already afflicted by lost jobs and homes will be shaken further by the closing of a neighbourhood school</strong>, particularly if the decision-making process has been acrimonious. <strong>Fallout from strained community relations, such as eroded confidence in decision making or withdrawn support for municipal bond measures, can affect school boards for years."</strong></p></li>
</ul><h2>Closing a School Will Decrease Property Values</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Bogart &amp; Cromwell (2000) showed that school redistricting, including some school
closures that led to busing of some school children, in Shaker Heights, Ohio in 1987 led to
disrupting neighborhood schools <strong>which reduced property values by 9.9 percent</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Colwell &amp; Guntennann (1984) measure the relation between housing values and proximity
to a school and calculate the financial impact of closing a neighborhood school. The perceived
benefits of a neighborhood elementary school are capitalized into residential property values. <strong>The study showed that school closing will lower property values</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>A study by Beta Biostatistics, Inc (2007) looked at the relationship between proximity to
schools in the Oshkosh Region and the sale prices of properties recently sold in the area. The study shows that there is a significant relationship between a residential property's proximity to public schools and the property's value as predicted by sales prices. <strong>The further a property is away from the schools, the less value a property might have</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Kwame, Espey &amp; Huiyan (2007) argue that <strong>the impact of school proximity appears to be as
significant in terms of property values as school quality is</strong>, with <strong>close proximity generally making a positive contribution to property values</strong> while greater than average distance from schools correlates with significantly lower property values. Moreover, Kwame &amp; Espey (1993) study of the impact of school quality on property values within the city limits of Greenville, SC suggests that <strong>greater distance to assigned K-12 schools has a negative impact on the value of the property</strong>. For assigned elementary schools, housing values within 2640 feet (quarter of a mile) were 18 percent higher than those beyond 10560 feet (two miles). Schools between 2640 and 5280 feet were 17 percent higher than those beyond 10560 feet. Schools between 5280 and 10560 feet were 7 percent higher in value. Assigned middle schools within 10560 feet sold for 16 percent higher than those beyond 10560 feet range. Assigned high schools within 10560 feet sold for 12 percent higher than those beyond 10560 feet range. Also, the results suggest that those who choose to live within the city limits of the study pay a premium to live in high quality school attendance areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Duncombe and Yinger (2010) argue that <strong>for the neighborhood that has lost its school,
property values tend to drop substantially as residents perceive disinvestment in their community</strong>. To some degree, <strong>school consolidation may break parents' valued connections with existing schools and result in higher transportation costs</strong> for parents and students.</p></li>
<li><p>According to the 2008 National Association of REALTORS® Profile of Home Buyers and
Sellers, 27% of home buyers listed school quality and <strong>21% listed proximity to schools as deciding factors in their home purchase</strong>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Here are some numbers specific to Ridgefield: </p>

<ul>
<li>General property taxes for 2011-2012 are $111,433,272. At a mill rate of 20.61 this corresponds to a total assessed value of $5,406,757,496. </li>
<li>In Connecticut, property is taxed at 70% of fair value, implying the fair value of property in the town is $7,723,939,280. </li>
<li>Just a 1% decline in property values corresponds to a value of $77,239,392, <strong>77 times the BOE's projected annual savings from closing a school.</strong>
</li>
<li>If a 1% decline in property values did occur, then eventually, as properties are re-assessed at their new fair values, <strong>tax revenue would decrease by more than $1M, offsetting any savings from closing the school in the first place.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h1>Other Concerns</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>The financial analysis to date has been very simplistic. The BOE should do a comprehensive net present value analysis showing multiple scenarios over the next 10-20 years, so that the community can compare the alternatives in today's dollars. </p></li>
<li><p>The BOE has not explained in fine detail where the $950,000-$1M savings figure comes from. It is hard to know if they have considered all of the potential costs from closing a school, such as the need for assistant principals in the remaining 5 schools, the cost to the town of continuing to maintain the shuttered school, and so on.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Even if the town were to save $1M per year due to closing a school:</p>

<ul>
<li>How much will it cost to later reopen the school when enrollment inevitably increases? Historically it has cost several million dollars to reopen a school. This could wipe out any accumulated savings. </li>
<li>What will be done with the money saved? There is no guarantee this will be applied to education, it could just be allocated to the general town fund.</li>
<li>$1M/year only represents slightly more than 1% of the BOE's $80M annual budget. What assurance is there that the BOE will not still have to bow and scrape to have the BOF approve its annual budgets? Will all the years of hand-wringing, mental and physical effort over the decision to close a school have been worth it?</li>
