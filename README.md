Background
===

The Ridgefield Board of Education is considering closing an elementary school due to a projected decline in K-5 enrollment below 2,000 students by 2014-2015.

The BOE claims this would save $950,000-$1M per year, about 1.2% of the $80M annual school operating budget. However, many Ridgefield citizens don't think they are considering all of the factors. Specifically, the effect that closing a school could have on property values in the town.

This website consolidates background info on the BOE's plans and scientific studies of the effects of school closure on property values. Armed with this information, citizens of Ridgefield can better judge whether closing a school is in the best interest of the community.

What's Wrong With Closing a School?
===

School Consolidation Does Not Save Money
---
- The decades following the 1960s saw an increase in the size of American schools and
classrooms. However, recent research indicates that **large schools do not work for minority and low income students, tend to hurt attendance and student participation, and are not necessarily cost efficient**. Irmsher (1997) summarizes the results of various studies that examined whether large schools have produced greater academic success at a lower cost; the ways in which small schools benefit students, parents, and teachers; and the need for establishing a collective school identity in conjunction with downsizing.

- Reeves (2004) and Eyre & Finn (2002) recount that between 1990 and 2000, total enrollment in West Virginia decreased 11%, 202 schools were closed, and education spending increased by 16%. **Per pupil expenditures increased more in West
Virginia than in any other state, but student achievement remained stagnant during this period.
Transportation and administrative costs rose in spite of the declining numbers of students.**. 

- Research by Cutshall (2003) reveals better outcomes for smaller schools or smaller learning communities within schools. **Data from 489 schools indicate that smaller size can be cost effective**. In light of these findings, some states are changing policies that favored consolidation and larger schools

School Consolidation Can Harm Academic Achievement

Closing a School Will Decrease Property Values
---
- Bogart & Cromwell (2000) showed that school redistricting, including some school
closures that led to busing of some school children, in Shaker Heights, Ohio in 1987 led to
disrupting neighborhood schools **which reduced property values by 9.9 percent**.

- Colwell & Guntennann (1984) measure the relation between housing values and proximity
to a school and calculate the financial impact of closing a neighborhood school. The perceived
benefits of a neighborhood elementary school are capitalized into residential property values. **The study showed that school closing will lower property values**.

- A study by Beta Biostatistics, Inc (2007) looked at the relationship between proximity to
schools in the Oshkosh Region and the sale prices of properties recently sold in the area. The study shows that there is a significant relationship between a residential property's proximity to public schools and the property's value as predicted by sales prices. **The further a property is away from the schools, the less value a property might have**.

- Kwame, Espey & Huiyan (2007) argue that **the impact of school proximity appears to be as
significant in terms of property values as school quality is**, with **close proximity generally making a positive contribution to property values** while greater than average distance from schools correlates with significantly lower property values. Moreover, Kwame & Espey (1993) study of the impact of school quality on property values within the city limits of Greenville, SC suggests that **greater distance to assigned K-12 schools has a negative impact on the value of the property**. For assigned elementary schools, housing values within 2640 feet (quarter of a mile) were 18 percent higher than those beyond 10560 feet (two miles). Schools between 2640 and 5280 feet were 17 percent higher than those beyond 10560 feet. Schools between 5280 and 10560 feet were 7 percent higher in value. Assigned middle schools within 10560 feet sold for 16 percent higher than those beyond 10560 feet range. Assigned high schools within 10560 feet sold for 12 percent higher than those beyond 10560 feet range. Also, the results suggest that those who choose to live within the city limits of the study pay a premium to live in high quality school attendance areas.

- Duncombe and Yinger (2010) argue that **for the neighborhood that has lost its school,
property values tend to drop substantially as residents perceive disinvestment in their community**. To some degree, **school consolidation may break parents' valued connections with existing schools and result in higher transportation costs** for parents and students.

- According to the 2008 National Association of REALTORS® Profile of Home Buyers and
Sellers, 27% of home buyers listed school quality and **21% listed proximity to schools as deciding factors in their home purchase**.

At best we save 1% of the budget annually, but the financial analysis has not been sophisticated
and does not account for the costs of reopening a school in the future when enrollment increases. Need to do NPV analysis over 10, 15, or 20 years.
